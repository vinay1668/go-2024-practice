Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with a complex CRUD project using the Gin framework in Go. This project will incorporate various advanced features to help you prepare for your interview. Here's a challenging project scenario:

Project: Advanced Library Management System API

You are tasked with creating a RESTful API for a library management system using the Gin framework. The system should handle books, users, loans, and reviews. Implement the following features:

User Management:

User registration and login with JWT authentication
Role-based access control (Admin, Librarian, Member)
Book Management:

CRUD operations for books
Search books by title, author, genre, or ISBN
Implement pagination for book listings
Allow filtering and sorting of books
Loan Management:

Allow members to borrow and return books
Implement due date tracking and overdue notifications
Limit the number of books a member can borrow
Review System:

Allow members to leave reviews and ratings for books
Implement CRUD operations for reviews
Calculate and display average ratings for books
Advanced Features:

Implement a recommendation system based on user preferences and borrowing history
Create a waitlist system for popular books
Implement a fine calculation system for overdue books
Add a feature for librarians to generate reports (e.g., most borrowed books, active users)
API Documentation:

Use Swagger for API documentation
Database:

Use PostgreSQL for data storage
Implement database migrations
Testing:

Write unit tests and integration tests for your API endpoints
Middleware:

Implement rate limiting
Add request logging
Implement CORS
Deployment:

Dockerize your application
Requirements:

Use Gin framework for routing and middleware
Implement proper error handling and validation
Use GORM as the ORM for database operations
Implement pagination for all list endpoints
Use JWT for authentication and authorization
Follow RESTful API design principles
Implement proper input validation and sanitization
Use environment variables for configuration
Implement proper logging throughout the application
Optimize database queries for performance
This project covers a wide range of features and will test your ability to work with Gin, databases, authentication, and various advanced concepts. It should provide excellent practice for your upcoming interview. Good luck with your preparation!
